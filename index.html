						<p id="projects"><strong>Personal projects</strong> <img src="https://patrick2734.github.io/images/FaceDetectionImg.png" style="width: 40px; height: auto;"></p>
						<p>
							<p>Facial recognition</br>
							I made a facial recognition using the Viola and Jones method in Java.
							The project detects faces and other elements of them from the camera and images.
							I used Java language to program it via OpenCV which allows us to use detection functions.
							The project is created by Viola and Jones Algorithm. This is an object detection framework proposed in 2001 by Paul Viola and Michael Jones.</p>
							<p>Fsharp code formatter</br>
							The project consists in implementing a program which, given as input an incorrectly indented F# program, produces as output the same correctly indented F# program.</p>
							<p>Online video game store simulation</br>
							The code was written in php for data preparation and processing. For the web interface, html, css (Pure) and javascript (jQuery, Parsley) were used.
							The DBMS used is PostgreSQL. For interactions between the web pages and the database, PDOs were used in order to avoid threats related to SQL injection through declaration preparation.</p>
							<p>Mine hunter robot</br>
							Using Lego – Mindstorm I built a robot which, receiving commands from a properly configured Android device, moves within the playing surface.
							This robot will have to recognize the mines placed on the playing field and collect those of the color assigned to it, keeping track of the positions where the mines are collected.
							At the end it places all the mines collected back in the position where they were at the beginning.</p>
							<p>Pepa hospital management</br>
							Using the Pepa plugin for Eclipse, a model for managing a hospital was created. Several components have been defined in cooperation with each other:
							Reception, ambulance, blood, X-rays, operation, recovery. These components are defined to perform each individual task.
							An additional Decide component has been defined to decide which activity to carry out for some patients requiring both blood tests and X-rays
							first in order to avoid too long waiting times.
