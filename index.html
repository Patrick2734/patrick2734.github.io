						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout my bachelor academic journey, I have had the opportunity to engage in several practical experiences that 
							have significantly contributed to my growth as a data scientist. During my undergraduate studies, 
							I completed an internship at <em>IT sector of the province of Venice</em>, where I worked on <em>geomaps</em>. 
							
							During this period I collaborated with the institution for the creation of some thematic tables of the General Territorial Plan (PTG), 
							creation of shapefiles regarding the bike sharing stations within the Metropolitan City of Venice and representation 
							on a map of the high schools within the territory.
							
							This experience allowed me to learn other concepts in real-world problems, enhancing my problem-solving skills.

						<p id="projects">
							<strong>Personal projects</strong> <img src="https://patrick2734.github.io/images/FaceDetectionImg.png" style="width: 40px; height: auto;">
							<a href="https://patrick2734.github.io/projects.html" style="text-decoration: none;">&xrarr;</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							<p>Facial recognition</br>
							I made a facial recognition using the Viola and Jones method in Java.
							The project detects faces and other elements of them from the camera and images.
							I used Java language to program it via OpenCV which allows us to use detection functions.
							The project is created by Viola and Jones Algorithm. This is an object detection framework proposed in 2001 by Paul Viola and Michael Jones.</p>
							<p>Fsharp code formatter</br>
							The project consists in implementing a program which, given as input an incorrectly indented F# program, produces as output the same correctly indented F# program.</p>
							<p>Online video game store simulation</br>
							The code was written in php for data preparation and processing. For the web interface, html, css (Pure) and javascript (jQuery, Parsley) were used.
							The DBMS used is PostgreSQL. For interactions between the web pages and the database, PDOs were used in order to avoid threats related to SQL injection through declaration preparation.</p>
							<p>Mine hunter robot</br>
							Using Lego – Mindstorm I built a robot which, receiving commands from a properly configured Android device, moves within the playing surface.
							This robot will have to recognize the mines placed on the playing field and collect those of the color assigned to it, keeping track of the positions where the mines are collected.
							At the end it places all the mines collected back in the position where they were at the beginning.</p>
							<p>Pepa hospital management</br>
							Using the Pepa plugin for Eclipse, a model for managing a hospital was created. Several components have been defined in cooperation with each other:
							Reception, ambulance, blood, X-rays, operation, recovery. These components are defined to perform each individual task.
							An additional Decide component has been defined to decide which activity to carry out for some patients requiring both blood tests and X-rays
							first in order to avoid too long waiting times.</p>
							<p>In progress</p>
							<p>3D Recostruction</br>
							The project contains two different programs:</br>
							1. A camera calibrator that loads the frames of the provided calibration video and computes the intrinsic parameters of the camera (the intrinsic matrix K and the lens distortion vector
							assuming a 5-parameters model) without any user intervention. This program outputs the Root Mean Square (RMS) re-projection error together with the calibration output.</br>
							2. A 3D scanner that reads one of the 3 videos provided (cat, cube, and ball) and processes it on a frame-by-frame basis. After processing all the frames (or during the processing), it
							computes a 3D point cloud with all the reconstructed 3D points of the scene that have been illuminated by the laser line. </p>
							<p>LiSA Taint Analysis</p>
							Taint analysis, used in communication networks to ensure data integrity, can be extended to datasets to prevent unauthorized modifications. 
							This project will develop a framework to trace data flow in datasets, marking and tracking each tuple's origin and transformations. 
							Key components include designing taint markers, developing integrity verification algorithms, and integrating these into existing database systems. 
							The goal is to enhance data security and reliability in applications like financial transactions, medical records, and governmental data.

							Finally, respecting cadences is crucial to my approach to work. I understand the importance of being punctual and completing tasks on time, both to meet customer needs and to contribute to the success of the entire organization. This attitude allows me to manage my time well, prioritizing tasks and ensuring that each project receives the attention and resources needed to be completed successfully.
